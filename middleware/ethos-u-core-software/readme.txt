1. Introduction
---------------
Arm Ethos-U65 microNPU is integrated into i.MX93 applications processors, enabling developers
to create more capable, cost-effective and energy-efficient ML applications. It improves
the inference performance of neural networks and is supported with an open-source driver and
compiler. The NPU targets quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN).

This component is Ethos-U core software for Cortex-M core. It provides the example applications
and core driver.

3. Inference with Ethos-U example applications
-----------------------------------------
3.1 Introduction
    The example ethosu_apps_rpmsg aims to parse the inference request from Cortex-A core, configure
    the NPUâ€™s registers, accomplish the inference, and send back the inference result to Cortex-A
    core. The inference engine is TensorFlow Lite or TensorFlow Lite Micro(TFLM).

    The example ethosu_apps accomplish the inference for conv2d op model. The inference engine is
    TensorFlow Lite Micro.

    The package contains Ethos-U example applications. The build projects can be found in
    the /boards/<board>/demo_apps/ethosu_apps* folders.

3.2 Toolchains supported
    - IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM
    - ArmGCC - GNU Tools ARM Embedded

3.3 Supported board and settings
    - mcimx93evk:
      No special settings are required.

4. Test process
---------------
4.1 Example ethosu_apps_rpmsg is built as .out or .elf and installed in rootfs. In Linux command line,
    user can run the following command to do inference for the model.
    #./inference_runner -d /dev/ethosu0 -n mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_pb_int8_vela.tflite -i stopwatch.bmp -l labels.txt -o output_data_detection -t 1080000000

    When the examples runs, the log and inference result would be seen on the terminal as below.

    For other demos, such as face recognition, please refer to the user manual.

4.2 Example ethous_apps is built as .bin. In U-Boot prompt, user can run the following command to do
    inference for the conv2d op model.
    u-boot=> tftp 0x80000000 ethosu_apps.bin;cp.b 0x80000000 0x201e0000 0x20000;bootaux 0x201e0000 0

    When the example runs, the log and inference result would be seen on the terminal as below.
