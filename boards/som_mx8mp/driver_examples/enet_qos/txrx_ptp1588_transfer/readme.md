Overview
========

The example shows the way to use ENET driver to
 receive and transmit frame in the 1588 feature required cases.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET.
2. How to get the time stamp of the PTP 1588 timer.
3. How to use Get the ENET transmit and receive frame time stamp.

The example transmits 20 number PTP event frame, shows the timestamp of the transmitted frame.
The length, source MAC address and destination MAC address of the received frame will be print.
The time stamp of the received timestamp will be print when the PTP message frame is received(the outside loopback cable can be used to see the right rx time-stamping log since we send the ptp message).

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.3

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- VAR-SOM-MX8M-PLUS SoM
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Example uses phy looback. No need to connect any network cable on port.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J19 USB Debug Port on the CPU board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
