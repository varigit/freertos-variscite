Overview
========
The lpuart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use lpuart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one lpuart instance connect to PC, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- USB to UART Adapter
- VAR-SOM-MX93 SoM(s) and Symphony Board(s)
- Proper power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect the power supply to the board and switch on the board.
2.  Connect the micro USB to J29 (Cortex-A55s) and the USB to UART adapter to J18.5/J18.3 (RX/TX) (Cortex-M33).
3.  Open a serial terminal on the Cortex-M33 serial port with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Load and start the demo on the M33 using either U-Boot (bootaux) or Linux (remoteproc) per the variwiki guide.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
