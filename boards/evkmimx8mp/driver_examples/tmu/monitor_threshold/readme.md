Overview
========
The TMU example shows how to configure TMU register to monitor and report the temperature from
multiple temperature measurement sites strategically located on the chip.

The TMU has access to multiple temperature measurement sites strategically located on
the chip. It monitors these sites and can signal an alarm if a programmed threshold is ever
exceeded.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMX8M Plus board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J23 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see the temperature output from the terminal when the pre-set threshold is reached.

NOTE: Average temperature threshold is 50 celsius degree by default, you can modify this value to facilitate testing the effect!
