Overview
========
In this demo, A core decoded music data and put it to DDR buffer and informs M core with the related information.
Then M core will take the ownership of consuming the buffer, it will copy buffer from DDR to TCM, manipulating EDMA4 to transfer the data to SAI and codec for playback.
It gives DDR and A core opportunity to do power saving for rather long time frame. M core will also take ownership of codec initialization.
SRTM(Simplified Real Time Messaging) protocol is used to communicate between A core and M core.
The protocol provides various commands for A core and M core to communicate with each other.
If there is no audio palyback, M core will enter the STOP mode, and the whole SOC system would enter deep sleep mode(DSM) once A core enter low power status.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Note! ####
1.  This case does not support ddr and flash target.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Make sure the FDT file and key bootargs are correctly set before booting the linux kernel. Following is the example commands on A core U-Boot console:
    =>setenv fdtfile imx93-11x11-evk-rpmsg.dtb
    =>setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs ${jh_clk} clk-imx93.mcore_booted console=${console} root=${mmcroot} snd_pcm.max_alloc_per_card=134217728'
    =>saveenv
5.  Boot Linux BSP to u-boot, and load M core image from SD card to run. (Put the image into SD card device before)
    => load mmc 1:1 0x80000000 imx93-11x11-evk_m33_TCM_sai_low_power_audio.bin
    => cp.b 0x80000000 0x201e0000 ${filesize}
    => bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0

******************
NOTE
******************
1.  The 16/24/32bits for PCM Music stream are supported.
2.  Since the music files are typically large, users could create a new large size partition in the SD card to place the music files.
3.  Please make sure audio file (such as xxx.wav) in any filesystem that Linux can access.

******************
Playback command
******************
Note:
1. Please use the command "cat /proc/asound/cards" to check the wm8962 sound card number (on A core Linux console).
E.g: Type command:
        ~# cat /proc/asound/cards
     The available sound cards can be shown:

     0 [micfilaudio    ]: micfil-audio - micfil-audio
                          micfil-audio
     1 [wm8962audio    ]: wm8962-audio - wm8962-audio
                          wm8962-audio

Then the wm8962 sound card number is 1.

When playback the .wav file (on A Core Linux console):
1.  If you want to playback with pause/resume command, below command can be used:
      "aplay -Dhw:1 xxx.wav -N";
    press space key on the keyboard to pause, and press the space key again to resume.
2.  93 board supports audio format of S16/S24/S32, and sample rates could be 32kHz, 48kHz and 96kHz, NOT inlcuding 44.1kHz.
3.  If want to playback with low power mode and specified period-size, could use command:
      "aplay -Dhw:1 --buffer-size=xxx --period-size=xxx xxx.wav -N &" or
      "aplay -Dhw:1 --buffer-time=xxx --period-time=xxx xxx.wav -N &".
    E.g: "aplay -Dhw:1 --period-time=500000 --buffer-time=10000000 xxx.wav -N &"
    Now please use "echo mem > /sys/power/state" command to make A core enter suspend mode and the playback work normally.
    Note, make sure the A core has enough time to fill the audio buffer before going into suspend mode.

When recording sound, could use command:
       arecord -Dhw:1,0 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE test.wav
