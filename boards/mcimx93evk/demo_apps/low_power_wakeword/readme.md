Overview
========
In this demo, M core receives audio from microphones and provide them to Linux on Cortex A in DDR and notifies it through RPMSG protocol.
If Linux is suspended, the audio is processed locally with teh selected algorithm
(VAD or wakeword or any future extension).
When voice algorithms triggers (VAD detects voice activity, or wakeword engine detects the wakeword), then A core
is resumed and audio streaming from M core to A core restarts.
When Cortex A is running, music playback from A core can also be sent to M core through DDR and RPMSG protocol but no playback is supported when M core only is running.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required. This demo uses the microphones from the EVK.

#### Note! ####
1.  This case does not support ddr and flash target.
2.  This case runs together with Linux and the Linux release version should be not lower than 5.15.X_2.0.0.
3.  wm8962 codec is used for audio playback and PDM microphones present on the EVK are used for audio recording through MICFIL hardware.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Boot Linux BSP to u-boot, and load M core image from SD card to run. (Put the image into SD card before.)
    => load mmc 1:1 0x80000000 imx93-11x11-evk_m33_TCM_low_power_wakeword.bin
    => cp.b 0x80000000 0x201e0000 0x30000
    => bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0
5.  Append "clk-imx93.mcore_booted" and "snd_pcm.max_alloc_per_card=134217728" in u-boot "mmcargs" env, before booting linux.
    => setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs ${jh_clk} console=${console} root=${mmcroot} clk-imx93.mcore_booted snd_pcm.max_alloc_per_card=134217728'
6.  Select the appropriate FDT file:
    => setenv fdtfile imx93-11x11-evk-rpmsg-lpv.dtb
7.  Boot Linux


Running the demo
================
When the demo boots successfully on M Core, the log on the terminal will look like:

******************
simple usage with audio record/play on Linux
******************


1. In Linux, check that the rpmsg sound cards for wm8962 and micfil have been setup, and note their ID (may vary between reboots)
    root@imx93evk:~# cat /proc/asound/cards
     0 [wm8962audio    ]: wm8962-audio - wm8962-audio
                          wm8962-audio
     1 [micfilaudio    ]: micfil-audio - micfil-audio
                          micfil-audio

2. In this case, micfil has ID: 1. Then start audio recording with command (-c option can be tuned to select number of microphones):
    arecord -Dhw:1,0 --buffer-time=10000000 -r16000 -fS32_LE -c4 test.wav

3. Make Linux on A core enter suspend:
    "echo mem > /sys/power/state"

4. When a wakeword ("Hey NXP") is detected by M core, Linux will resume and audio record will continue on Linux.

5. Following command can be used to playback an audio file:
      "aplay -Dplughw:0,0 xxx.wav"
   Note that playback will be automatically paused when Linux suspends and restarted after Linux has resumed.


******************
usage with NXP-AFE and advanced audio processing on Linux
******************
See NXP-AFE documentation in Linux User's guide to properly configure Linux ALSA paths and enable advanced audio processing applications.
Then Linux can be suspended by "echo mem > /sys/power/state"
It will be resumed when Cortex-M detects the wakeword.
