Overview
========
The freertos_lpspi_b2b_slave example shows how to use LPSPI driver in FreeRTOS.
In this example are required two boards, one board is used as LPSPI master on which
is runnuing freertos_lpspi_b2b_master and another board is used as LPSPI slave on which
is running freertos_lpspi_b2b_slave example.

Connection of boards is in section Board settings.

It is required to run first the slave demo.



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- two MCIMX93-EVK boards
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI3 pins are connected with SPI3 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0(SPI3)     CONNECTS TO         INSTANCE0(SPI3)
Pin Name   Board Location       Pin Name  Board Location
SPI3_SCK    J1001 pin 23        SPI3_SCK  J1001 pin 23
SPI3_SIN    J1001 pin 21        SPI3_SOUT J1001 pin 19

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either cold boot your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

This example uses two boards to connect with one as master and anohter as slave.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave
    CLK      --    CLK
    PCS      --    PCS
    SOUT     --    SIN
    SIN      --    SOUT

LPSPI slave transfer completed successfully.
LPSPI transfer all data matched !
