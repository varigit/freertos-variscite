Overview
========
The LPIT chained_channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT 
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second in the channel No.0, the channel 
No.1 chained with channel No.0, if LPIT contain more than two channels, the channel No.2 chained with 
channel No.1....the channel No.N chained with Channel No.N-1. 
Chaining the timer channel causes them to work in a 'nested loop' manner thereby leading to an effective
timeout value up to TVALn Ã— ((TVALn-1) + 1) at channel No.N. The timer counts down for 5 (TVALn + 1) timer
cycles until the timer reaches 0, then the timer generates an interrupt and loads the Timer Value register
(TVALn) value again. The example sets the timer period of the channel to 5 by using the API LPIT_SetTimerPeriod().
When the LPIT interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the serial terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see the similar information from the terminal shown as below.
Detail prints for each channel depends on by the total numbs of chained channels and the order of 
interrupt flag handler process for each channel.
