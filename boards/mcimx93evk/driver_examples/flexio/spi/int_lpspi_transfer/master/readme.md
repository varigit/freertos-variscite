Overview
========
The flexio_spi_master_interrupt_lpspi_slave example shows how to use flexio spi master driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated master connect to a lpspi slave .



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires doing connection between FLEXIO1(as master) pins and LPSPI3(as slave) pins.
- IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO09__LPSPI3_SIN(J1001-21), FLEXIO_SPI_SOUT_PIN(J1001-3) connected
- IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO10__LPSPI3_SOUT(J1001-19), FLEXIO_SPI_SIN_PIN(J1001-5) connected
- IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO11__LPSPI3_SCK(J1001-23), FLEXIO_SPI_CLK_PIN(J1001-7) connected
- IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO08__LPSPI3_PCS0(J1001-24), FLEXIO_SPI_PCS_PIN(J1001-29) connected

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO Master - LPSPI Slave interrupt example start.
This example use one flexio spi as master and one lpspi instance as slave on one board.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
FLEXIO_SPI_master -- LPSPI_slave
       CLK        --    CLK
       PCS        --    PCS
       SOUT       --    SIN
       SIN        --    SOUT
This is LPSPI slave call back.
FLEXIO SPI master <-> LPSPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of example.
