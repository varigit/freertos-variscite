Overview
========
The flexio_lpi2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master  driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to a LPI2C slave

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires doing connection between FLEXIO1(as master) pins and LPI2C1(as slave) pins.
- LPI2C1_SCL(J1005-3), IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO02__FLEXIO1_FLEXIO02(J1001-3) connected
- LPI2C1_SDA(J1005-5), IOMUXC_PAD_GPIO_IO03__FLEXIO1_FLEXIO03(J1001-5) connected

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
