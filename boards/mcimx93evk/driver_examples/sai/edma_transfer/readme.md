Overview
========
The sai_edma_transfer example shows how to use sai driver with EDMA:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using EDMA channel.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
Please run the application in single boot mode.

Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4. Boot Linux BSP to u-boot, and load M core image from SD card to run. (Put the image into SD card before.)
   => load mmc 1:1 0x80000000 /sdk20-app.bin
   => cp.b 0x80000000 0x201e0000 0x20000
   => bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0

Running the demo
================
Note: This demo outputs 215HZ sine wave audio signal.
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the terminal like:
