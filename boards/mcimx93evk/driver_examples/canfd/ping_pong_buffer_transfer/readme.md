Overview
========
The flexcan_pingpang_buffer_transfer example shows how to use the FlexCAN queue feature to create
2 simulate FIFOs that can receive CAN/CANFD frames:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send CAN/CANFD messages to
Endpoint B(board B) when user inputs the number of CAN messages to be sent in terminal. Endpoint B uses
two receiving queues to receive messages in turn, and prints the message content and the receiving queue
number to the terminal after any queue is full.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- Two MCIMX93-EVK board
- JLink Plus
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Switch S1101 to "ON" for two boards
The example requires connecting between CAN pins of two boards.
The connection should be set as follows:

Between two boards:
- J1101-2(CANH) node A, J1101-2(CANH) node B
- J1101-3(CANL) node A, J1101-3(CANL) node B
- J1005-7(GND) node A, J1005-7(GND) node B

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After connecting the two boards, these instructions display on each terminal window.
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between the node A and the node B.
