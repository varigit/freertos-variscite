Overview
========
The WDOG32 Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog32 driver.
In this example, fast testing is first implemented to test the wdog32.
After this, refreshing the watchdog in None-window mode and window mode is executed.
Note wdog32 is disabled in SystemInit function which means wdog32 is disabled
after chip emerges from reset.
