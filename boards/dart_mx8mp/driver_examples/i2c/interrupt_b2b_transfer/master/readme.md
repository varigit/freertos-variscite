Overview
========
The i2c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with interrupt:

In this example, one i2c instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.3

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- DART-MX8M-PLUS SoM
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
I2C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I2C interface, I2C3 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I2C3 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLAVE_BOARD        CONNECTS TO          MASTER_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
I2C3_SCL       J12-18         I2C3_SCL      J12-18 
I2C3_SDA       J12-20         I2C3_SDA      J12-20
GND            J12-15         GND           J12-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect proper power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW8 to power on the board
2.  Connect a proper cable between the host PC and the J12 header (pins UART3 TX, RX and GND) on the target board..
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

I2C board2board interrupt example -- Master transfer.
Master will send data :
