Overview
========
The EDMA memory to memory transfer example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It executes one shot transfer from source buffer to destination buffer using the SDK EDMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the EDMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- USB to UART Adapter
- DART-MX93 SoM(s) and CustomBoard(s)
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect the micro USB to J10 (Cortex-A55s) and the USB to UART adapter to J12.11/J12.13 (RX/TX) (Cortex-M33). 
2.  Open a serial terminal on the Cortex-M33 serial port with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Load and start the demo on the M33 using either U-Boot (bootaux) or Linux (remoteproc) per the variwiki guide.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
