# adc_interrupt

## Overview

The SAR ADC interrupt example shows the simplest way to use the SAR ADC driver.

In this example, three channels (channels 0, 1, and 2) are used to form a conversion chain,
these three channels are executed in the normal conversion scan mode. The end-of-channel
interrupt, pre-sample, DMA transfer and watchdog features of each channel in the conversion
chain are disabled, and the end-of-chain interrupt is enabled. The user should provide a
voltage signal as input to each conversion channel. When running the project, type any key
into the debug console to get these three channels' conversion result, when the conversions
in the chain are completed, the end-of-chain interrupt will be triggered, and if the result
of channel conversion is valid, it will be printed to the debug console.
