2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J31 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open two serial terminals (one for Cortex-M33 core, the other for Cortex-M7 core) with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example
