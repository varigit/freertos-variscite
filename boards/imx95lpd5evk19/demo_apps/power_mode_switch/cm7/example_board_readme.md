Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- IMX95LPD5-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for IMX95LPD5-EVK.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
How to enter system suspend mode(such as M7 use sm as wakeup source): In linux console use command "echo mem > /sys/power/state" to suspend A55, then select SUSPEND mode in Mcore debug console and input "S" into select SM as wakeup source, input "idle" command in M33 console. The STBY LED on board will light.
How to escape system suspend mode(such as M7 use sm as wakeup source): press enter in SM console, then input "wake" command to wakeup M7 and A55. Or press ONOFF button in board.
NOTE:
      1. M7 support LPTMR/LPUART/SM interface(wakeup command in sm consle or ONOFF button in board) wakeup source.
      2. Option 'P' will suspend A55 core.
      3. Please ensure the A55 already in SUSPEND mode, then press "W" button in Mcore debug console. A55 core will be wakeup.
